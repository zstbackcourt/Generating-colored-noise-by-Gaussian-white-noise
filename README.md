# Generating-colored-noise-by-Gaussian-white-noise




Colored noise can be easily generated by Gaussian white noise.In this project I try to generate pink,green,blue and purple noise by white noise.
There are 6 files in this project:
⑴ utils.py:defined some util functions&some global variables
⑵ BlueNoise.py:generate blue noise
⑶ GreenNoise.py:generate green nois
⑷ PinkNoise.py:geneerate pink noise
⑸ PurpleNoise.py:generate purple noise
⑹ MainWindowsUI.py:the main UI,you can run this file by"python3 MainWindowsUI.py"

Try to run script files above you need following settings:

Python3.6(>Python3.6);matplotlib;pyqt5;numpy;cv2
